		Graph mining is an important research area within the domain of data mining.
		The field of study concentrates on the identification of frequent subgraphs within graph data sets.
		The research goals are directed at:
		  (i) effective mechanisms for generating candidate subgraphs (without generating duplicates)
		  and (ii) how best to process the generated candidate subgraphs so as to identify the desired frequent subgraphs in a way that is computationally efficient and procedurally effective.
		This paper presents a survey of current research in the field of frequent subgraph mining, and proposed solutions to address the main research issues.},

This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of 19 frequent subtree
 mining algorithms and 25 frequent subgraph mining algorithms published in the
 early to mid 2000s. To start off, the authors provide preliminary formalisms,
 brief descriptions of five notable (sub)graph isomorphism algorithms, and a
 high-level overview of the approaches adopted by frequent subgraph / tree 
 mining (FGM/FTM) algorithms, such as certain strategies to subgraph candidate 
 generation and canonical labelling representations of graphs and trees. From 
 there, the focus shifts to the state-of-the-art for FTM algorithms followed
 by those more generally applicable to FGM.
\\ \\
In their discussion on FTM algorithms, they categorize algorithms by the nature 
 of the input trees (e.g. unordered vs. ordered, free, hybrid, maximal, closed, 
 induced, and embedded), and further delineate them by numerous factors: the 
 method of search space traversal and candidate subtree generation; the method 
 of support computation and the data structures used therein; whether
 exact or inexact matching is applied for support calculation; and a mentioning of the 
 ranking of these algorithms in regards to the experimental evaluation from the 
 originating papers.
\\ \\
In their discussion on FGM algorithms, algorithms are categorized by whether 
 they are general purpose or pattern dependent, subcategorized by the exactness 
 of candidate matches, further subcategorized by the type of input graph (e.g. 
 transaction graphs or a single graph), and even further subcategorized by the 
 strategy for candidate generation (e.g. breadth-first searching of the search 
 space or depth-first). Their discussion focuses on the algorithmsâ€™ 
 utilized canonical representations, specific approaches to candidate 
 generation, special data structures to facilitate certain operations, and some critical comments 
 on the performance benefits and drawbacks as evident in the originating papers.
\\ \\
Overall, the paper is well written in its brevity, yet comprehensive in its coverage. However, 
 there are portions that impede the clarity of certain topics, as well as 
 typographical and technical errors sparsely scattered throughout. In addition, 
 although the paper is comprehensive in its coverage of FSM algorithms in the 
 early to mid 2000s, the latest papers discussed date to 2008, which leaves a 
 four year gap between their covered state-of-the-art and this article's 
 surveyed works. The authors indicate that only incremental improvements of 
 existing strategies had been proposed during that period of time with no new 
 significant proposals. However, it would have been appropriate to provide 
 acknowledgements to these minor improvements at least as an after-comment to 
 those solutions on which improvements were made.
