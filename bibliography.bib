		Graph mining is an important research area within the domain of data mining.
		The field of study concentrates on the identification of frequent subgraphs within graph data sets.
		The research goals are directed at:
		  (i) effective mechanisms for generating candidate subgraphs (without generating duplicates)
		  and (ii) how best to process the generated candidate subgraphs so as to identify the desired frequent subgraphs in a way that is computationally efficient and procedurally effective.
		This paper presents a survey of current research in the field of frequent subgraph mining, and proposed solutions to address the main research issues.},
